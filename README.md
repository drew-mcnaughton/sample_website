Drew's New Sample Website
=========================

Getting used to using Markdown
------------------------------

This README.md file is purely for illustrative purposes. I decided to put it in
anyway as the book I'm using suggested it for an exercise but actually what was
most handy was the link to the [Markdown Website](https://daringfireball.net/
projects/markdown/).

Also just knowing how to add paragraphs like this.

I didn't realise before that Markdown was quite such the thing, especially
as Jekyll seems to use it too. But that's why I'm learning!

Next Steps
----------

1. Save this file.
2. Push it to the repo
3. Move on to the next section of the book "Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout
to Be Dangerous"
